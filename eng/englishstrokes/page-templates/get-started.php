		Welcome to the EnglishStrokes course! In this section, you can register to access the course and also  find out about how to use the website, how your course is organised and how to learn online. The  course follows a progress route from Beginner to Advanced with 10 units at each level.
		<p>Step 1: Get started with a game to find out your English level. Just play the game, answer some  questions and we will tell you which level to start at.</p>
		<p>Step 2: <a href="payment">Register </a>and make payment.</p>
		<p>Step 3: Start at Unit 1 and work your way through each unit before moving to the next level. You  can review your progress at any stage by checking the dashboard.</p>
		<p>Here are some tips that will help you make your online learning more effective... :</p>
		<p>1. Think about how often and for how long you can study online.</p>
		<p>We recommend you visit the website three or four times a week to study. Each time, try to study for  30 - 40 minutes. It's best to study frequently for short periods. This helps you to remember new  words and grammar.</p>
		<p>2. Your study schedule</p>
		<p>If possible it's a good idea to study at regular times. Try to study in a quiet place without any  distractions. You study better when you feel relaxed and when you're not too tired.</p>
		<p>3. Remembering new words</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Go to the Grammar and vocabulary sections. Review the grammar videos as often as necessary  and repeat the activities until you get all the 				answers right - this will help you understand and  remember the concepts. You can complete these exercises as many times as you like. </li>
				<li>Keep a record of new words as you see them. Write the words in a vocabulary book or in a Word  document. Always write the new word in a 				full sentence.</li>
				<li>A fun way to remember words is to label things around your home.</li>
			</ul>

		<p>4. Learning Grammar</p>
		<p>Many students think that grammar is the most important part of a new language. Grammar is important but words are important too. As you work 		through this section try to give equal importance to new words and new grammar.</p>
		<p>As you study English grammar try to think how it's different from the grammar of your language. This can help you to remember English grammar.
		</p>
		
		<p>5. Pronunciation</p>
		<p>There are also lots of short conversations to listen to. As you work through the material you'll get used to the sounds of English. There may be some sounds in English that don't exist in your language. Don't worry! You'll soon get used to recognising and using them correctly.</p>
