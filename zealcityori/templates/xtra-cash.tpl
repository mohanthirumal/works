	<p>Xtra cash is our very own unique deposit bonus system where players who deposit will be given extra cash credits according to the deposit made by a player.</p>
	<p>Xtra cash offers keep changing from time to time and you can check out the latest offers from our Add funds page.</p>
	<p>Xtra cash will be awarded only when a deposit offer has chosen, if the player enters their own amount in the deposit page the Xtra cash will not be given for the deposit made by the user. This means that users who want to deposit custom amounts will not be eligible for Xtra cash.</p>
	<p><b>How does the system work?</b></p>
	<p>For every cash tournament that a player plays a certain amount shall be added on to the Xtra cash section in the users account. Once the user reaches the full amount the Xtra cash will automatically get credited to the user. There is a time factor by which the user will have to collect their Xtra cash, if the time expires then the user will not be given the Xtra cash. The user can check their account in the bonus cash section to know more information about when their Xtra cash is going to expire.</p>
