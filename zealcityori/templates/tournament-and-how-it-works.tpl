	<div class="title">Tournaments and how it works?</div>
	<p>We offer Real money and free roll tournaments for all our players. Real money or Cash tournaments have an entry fee which each player must pay to join a real money tournament. In free roll tournaments we offer our players to play for free to earn real cash. Some of our free roll tournaments will have an entry fee in the form of frequent player points (FPP) which will allow only certain players with more than a particular FPP to participate in those tournaments.</p>
	<p>Real money and free roll tournaments are further classified into 3 types of tournaments.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Daily tournaments</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Here the players participate in a particular match which will end on a single day. Daily tournaments last only for one day and the winner is announced as soon as the real match is over. The winners are given their prize money based on the announced Prize pool for the tournament.</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Weekly tournaments</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Weekly tournaments last for a week usually starting from a Monday and ending on a Sunday. If a player enters our weekly tournaments the player will have to submit a team for all the games for the week. A player will submit one team per match and if a player misses submitting his team for a match then the player will not be awarded any runs (points) for that match. The player who scores the highest points at the end of the week is declared the winner.</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Series tournaments</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Similar to the weekly tournaments but last for the entire series. Each participating player will have to enter one team per real match and the player with the highest runs in the end of the series is declared the winner.</li>
		</ul>
