- Skill based games and fantasy games do not fall into this category since it's predominantly the skill of the player that decides the outcome of a game.<br/>
- Captain of captains is a game of skill.</p><br/>
<h1>Why Captain of Captains is a Skill based game?</h1>
<p>In Captain of Captains participants create virtual teams by selecting players (real cricketers) and such players would earn points based on the performance of the real cricketers in actual cricket matches. This would involve substantial degree of skill as a participant must analyze and study the skill, form, performance, health, fitness, and capabilities etc. of each real cricketer in order to form the virtual cricket team. Further, it would also be necessary to be constantly updated of the latest cricketing news and events such as tournaments and series, selection of players by real teams, conditions of each match, weather etc. In other words, we may contend that the online games involve a substantial degree of skill being exercised by each participant at every stage of the game and there is no element of chance, luck or gambling involved in such online games. This is an analysis of the online games provided by the websites based on the information forwarded by you. Needless to state that the determination of whether such online games involve substantial degree of skill and does not involve any element of luck, chance or gambling would require a thorough examination of the facts pertaining to each online game which may change from time to time.   
In light of the above and based on the information provided by Zealcity.com, the opinion of our lawyers have said that the provisions of the Public Gambling Act 1867 and the Prize Competitions Act, 1955 would not be attracted to the online games provided by www.zealcity.com, as mentioned above.</p>

					<p>There are standard fees for all cash Accounts as follows: Playing fee: Approximately 15%- 20% depending on the game , of the entry cost for a Cash or Progressive tournament represents a fee paid by you to us for hosting the Game service.

					<p><br>Withdrawal Fee: Each withdrawal from your Account will incur a processing fee of up to 5% per request. If an Account balance (excluding any non-withdraw able funds) is lower than the withdrawal processing fee, the withdrawal request will not be completed.</p>
					<p><br>When you credit your mobile Account with funds, the amount credited will be worth less than the amount that you paid. This is because you are charged a small transaction cost for making a deposit. The amount charged will be stated before you make payment.</p>
