            Zealcity.com is the place to play fantasy cricket on the web. We have now introduced the championship leader board where players can come and win exciting prizes by playing in our daily championship tournaments.<br/><br/>
			<b>How is a tournament classified as a Championship tournament?</b><br/>
			Every championship tournament shall have a mark of a star (symbol) next to the join button. Only tournaments that have this mark shall be classified as a championship tournament. So make sure you come and join the championship tournaments as there are very limited seats available for each tournament.<br/><br/>
			<b>So how does this work?</b><br/>
			It's simple, just come and play in our daily cash or free roll tournaments during a championship (For. E.g. during the world cup) As you take part in our free rolls or cash tournaments you get a chance to accumulate runs during the duration of that particular championship. Our system will automatically rank you according to the runs you have collected by playing in our championship tournaments.<br/><br/>
			<b>What is the schedule for a championship tournament?</b><br/>
			The championship schedule can be checked on our leader boards page under the championship section. We will also be announcing the championship schedule in advance and it can be checked on this link as well.<br/><br/>
			<b>What is the points system for calculating my rank in the championship leader boards?</b><br/>
			The points system is simple. As you take part in our daily fantasy tournaments, our system will calculate the entire runs you have scored in tournaments that qualify as a championship tournament and add your runs to the leader boards. You will be able to come and check your rank in  the leader boards section and it will clearly show whether you are going to win the most coveted prize on fantasy cricket.<br/><br/>
