	<p>Zealcity points is our own loyalty program that gives our users loads of goodies that can be claimed for free! ZCP's allows user players to claim free gifts such as the latest smart phone or the latest gaming consoles or even gift cards for free.</p>
	<p><b>So how does it work?</b></p>
	<p>Every cash game that you play you earn a few ZCP's and once you reach a certain target you will be able to claim free items from our VIP section. We will announce our prizes that can be claimed every month. ZCP's are given strictly only in cash tournaments or free roll tournaments where you get placed. This means that you will have to be one of the winners in our free roll tournaments to qualify for ZCP's.</p>
	<p>The breakdown for ZCP's have been listed below, if you have any further queries just drop us a mail to <a href="mailto:support@zealcity.com">support@zealcity.com</a>and you can enjoy the benefits.</p>
